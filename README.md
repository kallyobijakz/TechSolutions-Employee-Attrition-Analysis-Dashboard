## Overview
TechSolutions is a global leader in technology solutions, specializing in software development, IT consulting, and innovative technology services. With a workforce of over 1,000 employees worldwide, TechSolutions is committed to fostering growth and satisfaction among its diverse talent. However, rising employee attrition has recently impacted productivity, increased hiring costs, and created challenges in sustaining an engaged workforce.

To address these challenges, TechSolutions has collaborated with 10Alytics, a data-driven analytics company, to develop a comprehensive Employee Attrition Analysis Dashboard. This tool aims to provide actionable insights into the factors influencing employee attrition and assist the HR department in developing effective retention strategies.

## Objectives
This project focuses on the following objectives:

Identify Key Drivers of Employee Attrition:

Understand the main factors influencing employee turnover, such as tenure, job role, compensation, and department.
Analyze Voluntary Departure Trends:

Examine trends in voluntary departures across different demographics, tenure brackets, and roles to uncover patterns in attrition.
Provide Data-Driven Insights for HR Strategies:

Enable the HR team to make informed decisions on employee engagement, retention policies, and satisfaction improvement.

## Technologies Used
This analysis was conducted using Tableau, leveraging advanced data visualization and high-level dashboarding skills. Tableau’s capabilities enabled dynamic, interactive visualizations to present key insights. Collaboration with 10Alytics supported the dashboard’s development, ensuring a comprehensive, data-driven approach to understanding and addressing employee attrition.

## Key Features
Attrition Trends and Patterns

Analysis of overall attrition rates segmented by department, tenure, role, and other demographic factors.
Year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter attrition trends, highlighting critical periods of increased turnover.
Employee Demographics and Tenure Analysis

Visual breakdown of employee tenure, identifying when turnover risk is highest.
Interactive Dashboard Visualizations

Customizable filters allow users to explore data by department, role, and tenure length.
Heatmaps, bar charts, and trend lines provide an accessible view of attrition trends and drivers.

## Project Structure
